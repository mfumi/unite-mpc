USAGE                                           *unite-mpc-usage*

:Unite mpc
:Unite mpc:listall
    List all songs in the music dir.
    It parses music information itself, so if the number of songs is large,
    it takes long time to candidate information.
    (If you have over ten thousands of songs, it'll take several tens of 
     seconds)
    Once it is called, the candidates is cached.
:Unite mpc:listall2
    Same as mpc:listall excepet it uses "mpc listall" result.
    So,it much faster than "mpc:listall", but information which is displayed
    is only file name.


:Unite mpc:playlist
    List all songs in the currentry playlist.
    It parses music information itself, so if the number of songs is large,
    it takes long time to candidate information.
    Once it is called, the candidates is cached.
:Unite mpc:playlist2
    Same as mpc:playlist excepet it uses "mpc playlist" result.
